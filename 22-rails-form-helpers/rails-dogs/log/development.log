ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken (The browser returned a 'null' origin for a request with origin-based forgery protection turned on. This usually
means you have the 'no-referrer' Referrer-Policy header enabled, or that the request came from a site that
refused to give its origin. This makes it impossible for Rails to verify the source of the requests. Likely the
best solution is to change your referrer policy to something less strict like same-origin or strict-origin.
If you cannot change the referrer policy, you can disable origin checking with the
Rails.application.config.action_controller.forgery_protection_origin_check setting.

ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken (The browser returned a 'null' origin for a request with origin-based forgery protection turned on. This usually
means you have the 'no-referrer' Referrer-Policy header enabled, or that the request came from a site that
refused to give its origin. This makes it impossible for Rails to verify the source of the requests. Likely the
best solution is to change your referrer policy to something less strict like same-origin or strict-origin.
If you cannot change the referrer policy, you can disable origin checking with the
Rails.application.config.action_controller.forgery_protection_origin_check setting.
