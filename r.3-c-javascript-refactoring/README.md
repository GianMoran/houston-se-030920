# Refactoring Techniques

### 1) Break code up into different functions
* `renderPenguingotchi`
* `renderFeedBtn`
    * When you run into scope challenges (leaky abstractions), then maybe its time for 

### 2) Stateful Rendering
* Re-rendering larger sections of the page when our data changes


### 3) Write Helper Functions
* If you are tired of writing `document.createElement`, abstract it!
